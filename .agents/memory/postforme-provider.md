description: Active social auto-posting provider (replaced bundle.social, Aug 2026) — API quirks, Quickstart project limits, ownership and webhook rules
---

Post for Me (postforme.dev, user's Pro plan) is the ONLY posting provider. bundle.social is fully removed.

**API basics.** Base `https://api.postforme.dev/v1`, `Authorization: Bearer POSTFORME_API_KEY` (server-only secret — never in client code or logs). Platform slugs lowercase: facebook, instagram, x, tiktok, youtube, pinterest, linkedin, bluesky, threads, tiktok_business. Post status enum `draft|scheduled|processing|processed`; per-account outcomes ONLY via `GET /social-post-results?post_id=` (`success` flag + error). `DELETE /social-posts/:id` cancels (404 = already gone). `GET /social-posts?external_id=` recovers ambiguous creates.

**Ownership.** Accounts/posts are tagged `external_id = user_<id>`, but PFM dedupes the same physical account project-wide — the local connections table is the ownership authority. Every route taking account ids must verify locally and 403 on foreign ids; never trust PFM's external_id alone.

**Quickstart project limits (user's current plan tier).**
- Platforms must be ENABLED per-platform in PFM dashboard → Project Setup, else auth-url returns 404 "Social provider app credentials not found". This is user-side config, not code.
- `redirect_url_override` is REJECTED ("Redirect URL Override is not allowed for Quickstart Projects") — the dashboard's single Project Redirect URL is used. Code sends the override first and auto-falls back without it on that error, so it works on both project tiers.
- Consequence: OAuth always lands on the dashboard-configured (prod) callback even when initiated from dev; dev still picks the account up via external_id sync on the next accounts load.

**Why:** all three discovered by live smoke against the real key; the error precedence (override-check vs credentials-check) differs per platform, so don't infer enablement from which error comes back.

**Login variants.** When BOTH login variants of a platform are enabled in the PFM dashboard, auth-url REQUIRES `platform_data: { <platform>: { connection_type } }` (nested by platform key, same pattern as post platform_configurations) — instagram: "instagram"|"facebook", x: "oauth1"|"oauth2". Top-level `connection_type` is silently ignored (same 400 repeats). Whitelist-validate client input server-side; default x→oauth2. Bluesky auth-url returns 201 with an EMPTY `url` (app-password platform, no OAuth page) — treat empty url as not-connectable-via-API and surface honestly instead of a generic 502.

**Webhooks.** Deliveries carry plain-compare header `Post-For-Me-Webhook-Secret`; must 2xx within ~1s (PFM retries ~8x/24h). Verify via cached DB secrets: primed at boot, stale-served on DB error, sub-second race → 401 fail-closed on timeout. Ack first, process async + idempotent (replays and late events must be no-ops; never demote a posted marker).

**Media.** PFM fetches media by URL at/near publish time. User-supplied URL scheduling must pass a DNS-resolving SSRF check (`urlResolvesPublic`) at enqueue AND again at handoff; Drive confirm tokens are one-time so direct-URL resolution happens at handoff, not enqueue. Scheduler drain: `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` lease + attempts cap + never schedule in the past.

**How to apply:** any new posting feature goes through the local ownership check + claim markers (see clip-post-idempotency.md); any new user-URL intake needs the DNS-level SSRF check; platform enablement problems are dashboard config, surface them honestly (409) instead of retrying.

## 'processed' is NOT success (Aug 2026 incident)
PFM post status 'processed' only means "finished attempting". Truth lives in per-account results (`GET /social-post-results?post_id=`). Blind processed→posted showed POSTED ✓ while every account had failed.
**Rule:** aggregate mapping — all-fail→failed (+real error), partial→posted+surfaced error, empty results→processing with 15-min optimistic grace. Every aggregate status write is compare-and-set on the observed status so webhook truth beats stale refresh/cached views. Never demote per-account clip_account_posts 'posted' markers; only the aggregate row self-corrects.

## Scheduled (delayed) posts have their own status
PFM `scheduled|draft` must map to a distinct 'scheduled' clip status — folding them into 'processing' lets the UI's capped fast-poll window settle them as fake POSTED. Provider-unreachable fallback: a non-posted marker whose linked social_posts row has a FUTURE scheduled_at reports 'scheduled', never 'processing'. UI rule: scheduled cards use a slow uncapped watch; the capped 5s poll is only for actively-publishing posts, and its give-up fallback may only promote 'processing'→'posted', nothing else.

## Drive media must be relayed
PFM's fetcher cannot consume drive.google.com direct/confirm URLs (one-time confirm tokens rot, big files hit the "can't scan for viruses" HTML interstitial) → all-account media failure. Hand PFM our signed relay URL (`/api/video/gdrive-relay/<HMAC token>`, SESSION_SECRET-signed, stateless) and re-resolve Drive fresh per fetch. TTL must outlive the PUBLISH moment (provider fetches bytes at publish, not at handoff) — stretch by scheduled_at, clamp 30–400d.

## Empty results ≠ evidence (never optimistic-promote)
Rule: a post may only be shown/stored as posted when an explicit per-account SUCCESS result exists. PFM 'processed' with zero visible results means "truth not visible yet" → stay processing. A failed results fetch must surface as ambiguous state (null), never be swallowed into an empty list — empty-by-error is indistinguishable from empty-by-truth and gets misread as "nothing failed".
**Why:** live incident (Aug 2026): rows correctly marked failed ("All media failed to process") were resurrected to POSTED after a redeploy — webhook retries re-evaluated them, the results fetch hiccuped into [], and a 15-min "settle optimistic" rule promoted zero-evidence rows. User saw 3 green POSTED ticks for videos that never reached YouTube.
**How to apply:** every path that persists an aggregate or per-account post status (webhook processed events, poll refresh, live status feeds, create/recovery persistence) must route through the same evidence-based mapper; empty results never move a settled (failed/posted) row; honest-stuck-in-processing beats silent lies — results were verified to persist ≥18h on the provider, so later polls settle truth.
