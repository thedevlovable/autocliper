/**
 * Posting credits — the rule that makes plans mean something for Auto-Pilot
 * and bulk scheduling:
 *
 *   • Every video PUSHED to social accounts costs CREDITS_PER_POST, unless it
 *     is a platform-made clip. Clips already paid CREDITS_PER_CLIP when they
 *     were generated, so posting them is included in that price — but
 *     Drive/Dropbox folders, Instagram reposts and pasted links would
 *     otherwise post for free, forever, on any plan.
 *   • No credits → no hand-off. The row waits (hold_until) and resumes by
 *     itself after a top-up; it never posts on an empty balance.
 *
 * Charge point is provider hand-off — the moment we commit the post to the
 * provider. The reservation and the row marker (credit_sub_spent /
 * credit_topup_spent) commit in ONE transaction keyed on status='creating',
 * so a cancel racing the charge rolls the whole thing back, retries can never
 * double-charge, and a crash can never strand a hold without its marker.
 *
 * Refunds are deliberately NOT sprinkled across every failure writer.
 * A single idempotent sweep (called from the drain tick) refunds any terminal
 * row (failed/cancelled/deleted) still carrying a charge — one place that
 * covers the drain, cancel endpoints, housekeeping, webhook and reconciler
 * alike, including failure writers added in the future.

 *     (service was delivered — keep the charge); found + cancelled/deleted →
 *     take the provider post down, then refund; lookup error or no provider
